# BouncingBall


Name: BouncingBallApp


Description: This is a bouncing ball project that I have been expanding on as part of a professional certificate in coding. It moves a ball randomly across the screen within set parameters. The initial code that created the ball and x and y axis's was already provided. 

Support: Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about it. 

Roadmap: I would like to implement a feature that will add an additional ball to the screen as well.
